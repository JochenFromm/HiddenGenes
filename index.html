      It has been said when climbing mount Everest, the last hundred yards are the hardest. This is certainly true for writing a book as well. The longer it takes, the more difficult it becomes. The last meters are the worst. If you want it to be good, you have to read and proofread your own text over and over again until you cannot see it anymore and then still 10 times more.

      But here it is, my new book named “Hidden Genes”, written in the last months of the global Coronavirus pandemic. I have sent a proposal to over 30 publishers, but almost all of them rejected the proposal. Therefore I have decided to publish it myself, using a self-publishing service. If you are an old-fashioned book lover like me, you can buy it here in the <a href="https://www.epubli.de/shop/buch/hidden-genes-jochen-fromm-9783752986006/102283">epubli shop</a> or here at <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/375298600X/ref=olp_product_details">Amazon</a> in Europe. I hope you will find it interesting, and most typos should hopefully be eliminated now.

      The book is a bit of an adventure: to see if we can study things that can not be studied, if we can measure effects that can not be measured. Arthur C. Clarke said “the only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible”. In my opinion this journey was successful. The text contains in fact new, groundbreaking insights which you can read in this form nowhere else.

      Are there any “hidden genes” in our world as the title suggests? Where are they hidden? And how do they work? The thesis of the book is that there are hidden genes that have not been recognized so far as what they are – genes that have the ability to create organisms if they are expressed regularly. They look different than classic DNA, but work in exactly the same way. The book shows where these hidden genes are exactly and how they are expressed (how often, by whom, and where), argues why this can go wrong, and explains what the result looks like. I hope it may help to inspire others on their journey to new insights.
